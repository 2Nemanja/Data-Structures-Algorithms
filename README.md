# Data Structures & Algorithms

A Few files ive made in C++ that cover some fundamentals in data structures and algorithms and making my own functions such as add, append, invert, pop etc..

Can be very usefull for someone that is just getting into C++ or even for someone that wants to know how things acctually happen when using some built in functions :)
